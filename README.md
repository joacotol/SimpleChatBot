# Simple Chat Bot

This project will allow me to create a simple chat bot to further improve my understanding of Java as a programmer. This project is based from a similar project from JetBrains Academy. However all of source code and files are created by me.JetBrains Academy only provides a guideline on what the project is about and its features. Later on, I will revisit this project and add my own features that are not part of the original project itself.

## Objectives:
- 1st: write a bot the displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation
- 2nd: introduce yourself to the bot, the bot will then greet you by your name
- 3rd: the chat bot will try to guess your age using arithemtic operations
- 4th: the bot will count from 0 to any positive number that the user enters
